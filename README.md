## Welcome to my first Swift App!

### How to get started

Open a terminal to the root of the project

Run `pod install` to install all the dependicies

If you don't have cocoapods installed, install it using `sudo gem install cocoapods`

For those not in the know, cocoapods is the dependency manager used by Swift, and makes using external libraries even easier :)
